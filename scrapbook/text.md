## About Page

### Our Mission
CLIMB exists to democratise access to cutting-edge computational resources for all bioinformaticians, no matter their career level. We aim to accelerate scientific discovery by providing researchers with the infrastructure, tools, and support needed to analyse their data efficiently and effectively.

### Our History
Launched in 2014 with initial funding from the Medical Research Council (MRC), MRC-CLIMB (Cloud Infrastructure for Microbial Bioinformatics) was established to address the growing computational needs of microbial genomics researchers. Following its success, CLIMB-BIG-DATA was awarded additional funding to expand its capabilities and serve the broader microbial bioinformatics community.

For over a decade, CLIMB has been at the forefront of supporting groundbreaking research in microbial genomics, including pivotal contributions to pathogen surveillance during disease outbreaks and ongoing public health initiatives.

In 2025, CLIMB is entering a new phase of growth and sustainability, consolidating its position as a National Capability for microbial bioinformatics infrastructure in the UK and expanding its services to reach a global audience.

### Leadership and Team
CLIMB is led by an experienced team of researchers and computational experts from leading UK institutions:

- Professor Nick Loman - CLIMB Director
- Lisa Marchioretto - Operations Manager
- Radoslaw Poplawski - Technical Lead
